My project will focus on integrating GWAS results with epigenetic datasets. 
Code will be written which takes a list of paths to peak files produces from genome wide chip-seq and accessible chromatin assays which will then be intersected with the location of the SNPs in question. 

From this, a matrix will be outputted with a 0 assigned to SNPs which do not co-localise to epigentic peak, and a 1 to those which do. 

From this, it will become apparent which SNPs are functionally enriched and will then be priorised for functional followup.
